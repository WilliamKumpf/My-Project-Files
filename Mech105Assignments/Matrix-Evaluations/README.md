# This function has LU Factorization using Gauss Elimination to solve matrices.
The function requires the user to input an initial nxn matrix and a column matrix. The function then evaluates the matrices using partial pivoting and Gausse Elimination to output a lower and upper triangular matrix, as well as an identity matrix to determine where the initial matrix was pivoted.
