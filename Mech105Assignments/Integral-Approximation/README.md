# This Matlab function uses the Simpson's 1/3 rule to approximate the integral
For the code to run properly, the user needs to put in two vectors of equal size, otherwise an error will occur.
The vectors are typically found using some data that had previously been collected which the user enters as the vectors.
The function will then output an approximation of the integral.
